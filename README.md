Description for the wro
The creation had several steps such as the choice of pieces, as well as their programming, here I am going to explain this process. First we were looking for the parts for the construction of the vehicle, pieces such as the motion sensors, the color sensor, the base for the vehicle, the brain, the 4 wheels among others.Then we got down to work, and we started to assemble the vehicle, if you saw problems with the construction but in the end we were able to solve it and have our vehicle ready, the next thing we did was to do the programming in Spike, at the beginning as always it was difficult because the vehicle did not turn as it had to so we had to check the programming a lot of times to make sure it worked,  We did a couple of practices to see if it turned around as it had to do and in the end everything turned out well, the next challenge was the color sensor since there were times when it did not detect the color well or did not rotate as it had to turn then we gave it and we gave it until it worked, We are still having problems with the color sensor but we are still trying to know or improve that programming so that in the competitions it was better than in the practices.
thanks you for the attention.
